# NLP Fake News Detector

* This project aim at detecting fake new using a Recurrent Neural Network. 

I train a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network to detect fake news from a given news corpus. 

This project could be practically used by media companies to automatically predict whether the circulating news is fake or not. 


Apply python libraries to import and visualize dataset

Perform exploratory data analysis and plot word-cloud

Perform text data cleaning such as removing punctuation and stop words

Understand the concept of tokenizer.

Perform tokenizing and padding on text corpus to feed the deep learning model.

Understand the theory and intuition behind Recurrent Neural Networks and LSTM

Build and train the deep learning model

Access the performance of the trained model


## Task 1: Understand the Problem Statement and business case

* Right now we are in a world of mis-information and fake news. This project aims at detecting fake news with Recurrent Neural Networks and LSTM (a type of Recurrent Neural Networks)

* Natural Language Processing (NLP) work by converting words(text) into numbers. 

* These numbers are then used to train an AI/ML model to make predictions.

It is like I'm going to make a binary classification to tell whether the input news is True/ Fake.
