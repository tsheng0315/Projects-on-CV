# NLP Fake News Detector

we will train a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network to detect fake news from a given news corpus. 

This project could be practically used by media companies to automatically predict whether the circulating news is fake or not. 

The process could be done automatically without having humans manually review thousands of news-related articles.

Apply python libraries to import and visualize dataset
Perform exploratory data analysis and plot word-cloud
Perform text data cleaning such as removing punctuation and stop words
Understand the concept of tokenizer.
Perform tokenizing and padding on text corpus to feed the deep learning model.
Understand the theory and intuition behind Recurrent Neural Networks and LSTM
Build and train the deep learning model
Access the performance of the trained model
