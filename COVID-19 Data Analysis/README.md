# COVID-19-Data-Analysis

* This project is based on COVID-19 dataset published by John Hopkins University, which consist of the data related to cumulative number of confirmed cases, per day, in each Country. 

* Also we have another dataset consist of various life factors, scored by the people living in each country around the globe. 

* We are going to merge these two datasets to see if there is any relationship between the spread of the the virus in a country and how happy people are, living in that country.

* We are going to preprocess and merge datasets to calculate needed measures and prepare them for an Analysis.

### Task 1: Importing COVID19 dataset
* Import COVID19 dataset and prepare it for the analysis by dropping columns and aggregating rows.

### Task 2: Finding a good Measure
* Decide on and calculate a good measure for our analysis.

### Task 3: Importing World happiness report dataset
* Import World happiness report dataset, dropping useless columns and Merge it with COVID19 dataset to find correlations among our data.

### Task 4: Visualizing the results
* Visualize our results using Seaborn.
