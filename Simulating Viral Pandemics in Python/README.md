Learn basics of implementing the SIR model.
Implementing an agent-based simulation of the SIR model of contagion transmission.
Implementing simulated mitigation efforts and real world data.
By the end of this course, you will be able to code a basic agent-based simulation of the SIR epidemiological model in Python, allowing you to successfully experiment with simulations of pandemic spread in Python and preparing you for further progression in your path to learning to implement predictive analytics in Python.

Course Structure
This course is divided into 3 parts:

Course Overview: This introductory reading material.
Simulating Viral Pandemics in Python: This is the hands on project that we will work on in Rhyme.
Graded Quiz: This is the final assignment that you need to pass in order to finish the course successfully.
Project Structure
The hands on project on Simulating Viral Pandemics in Python is divided into following tasks:

Task 1: Learn about the SIR Model
Task 2: Build the Basic Structure of our SIR Model
Task 3: Run our First Basic Simulation
Task 4: Simulating Mitigation Policies and Asymptomatic Populations
Task 5: Adding Real Data
