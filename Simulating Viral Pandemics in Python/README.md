## Simulating Viral Transmission

This project aims in implementing an agent-based simulation of the SIR epidemiological model of contagion transmission in Python to simulating the pandemic spread.

### Project Structure
* Task 1: Exploring the basics of the SIR model
* Task 2: Build the Basic Structure of SIR Model
* Task 3: Run First Basic Simulation
* Task 4: Simulating Mitigation Policies and Asymptomatic Populations
* Task 5: Implement a real-world data for scientific simulations
