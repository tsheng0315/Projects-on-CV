# University Admission Prediction Using Multiple Linear Regression

## Project Overview: 

This project aims at predicting the chance of being admitted into a particular University using regression.

## Project Structure

### Task 1: Problem Statement and Background

### Task 2: Check data-sets

As shown in the table, the column 'Chance of Admit' is the result we hope to predict.

And as the value in column 'Chance of Admit' is continuous, here I use Regression Model (If it is binary values like True/False, then we go for Classfication). 

Task 3: Perform Exploratory Data Analysis 

Here I perform exploratory data analysis and standardize the training and testing data.

The desciption of data:

Group the data by university ratings to show more detailed information.

As we can see from the table, on average, the higher reating the university is, the higher GRE/TOEFL/GPA score, longer SOP, more strengh on Letter Of Recommendation and REsearch Experience students are. And chances of getting admitted are higher as well.

Task 4: Perform Data Visualization

Create  histographs to obtain a general look of the distribution of data.

Task 5: Create Training And Testing Datasets

Task 6: Train And Evaluate A Linear Regression Model

Task 7: Train And Evaluate an Artificial Neural Networks Model

Task 8: Train And Evaluate A Random Forest and Decision Tree Regressors

Task 9: The difference between regression KPIs

Task 10: Calculate regression model KPIs


1. Understand the theory and intuition behind Multiple Linear Regression.

4. Train and Evaluate different regression models using Sci-kit Learn library.

5. Build and train an Artificial Neural Network to perform regression.

6. Understand the difference between various regression models KPIs such as MSE, RMSE, MAE, R2, and adjusted R2.

7. Assess the performance of regression models and visualize the performance of the best model using various KPIs.
