Course Objectives
In this course, we are going to focus on the following learning objectives:

1. Understand the theory and intuition behind Multiple Linear Regression.

2. Import Key python libraries, dataset and perform data visualization

3. Perform exploratory data analysis and standardize the training and testing data.

4. Train and Evaluate different regression models using Sci-kit Learn library.

5. Build and train an Artificial Neural Network to perform regression.

6. Understand the difference between various regression models KPIs such as MSE, RMSE, MAE, R2, and adjusted R2.

7. Assess the performance of regression models and visualize the performance of the best model using various KPIs.

Course Structure
This course is divided into 3 parts:

Project Overview: This introductory reading material will walk you through the project.
Predict the chance of being admitted into a particular University using regression: This is the hands on project that we will work on in Rhyme.
Graded Quiz: This is the final assignment that you need to pass in order to finish the course successfully.
